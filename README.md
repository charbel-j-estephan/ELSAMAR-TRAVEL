## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/charbel-j-estephan/ENG202.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd django-website
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. Create a superuser for accessing the admin interface:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
8. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
9. Access the admin interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials.
10. Create and manage products, upload images and brochures, and customize background visuals through the admin interface.

## Customization and Extension
- To customize the website's design, modify HTML templates and static files in the app's `templates/` and `static/` directories.
